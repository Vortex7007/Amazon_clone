## How to Start the Backend Server

In the `Backend` directory, use the following command to start the backend server:

```
npm start
```

This will run the backend using the script defined in `package.json`.

---

## Notes
- Make sure you have installed all dependencies with `npm install` before running the server.
- The backend uses `npm start` (not `nodemon` or any other script by default).

For frontend instructions, see the `frontend/README.md` file.
